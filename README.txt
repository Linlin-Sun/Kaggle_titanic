This is a project for a Kaggle titanic competition. 

As a newbie in the data science world, I would like to use this educational competition as one of my learning guides. I will try with different methods to see how good my prediction will get. The methods include what I learned from my current courses and from the notebooks that other more advanced users posted on kaggle.
